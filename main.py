# 🐶 Python OOP Challenge: Build Your Own Digital Pet
# Welcome to this week's Python challenge! 🎉

# In this challenge, you’ll be creating a virtual pet using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. This fun project will help you practice how to use classes, attributes, methods, and constructors.

#  Empty heading

# 🧠 Objective
# Create a class called Pet with the following:

# Attributes:
# name: the name of your pet
# hunger: an integer representing hunger level (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
# energy: an integer representing energy level (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
# happiness: an integer (0–10)
# Methods:
# eat(): reduces hunger by 3 points (but not below 0), and increases happiness by 1.
# sleep(): increases energy by 5 points (but not above 10).
# play(): decreases energy by 2, increases happiness by 2, and increases hunger by 1.
# get_status(): prints the current state of the pet.
# Bonus 🎯
# Add a method train(trick) that teaches your pet a new trick and stores it in a list.
# Add a method show_tricks() that prints all learned tricks.

# 📝 How to Complete
# Fork or clone this repo: https://github.com/Evans-mutuku/OOP-Challenge
# Write your Pet class in pet.py.
# In main.py, create a pet object and call its methods to test functionality.
# Submit a GitHub repo or a zipped folder with your code and a screenshot of the output.


from pet import Pet

# Create a pet
my_pet = Pet("Pejjy")

# Interact with your pet
my_pet.get_status()
my_pet.eat()
my_pet.sleep()
my_pet.play()
my_pet.train("roll over")
my_pet.show_tricks()
my_pet.get_status()
